# M2S2 eCAL Deserializers


## Description
This repo contains deserializers for [eCAL](https://github.com/eclipse-ecal/rmw_ecal) measurements of four ROS2 messages used in our [M2S2](m2s2_ws) drivers.

The deserializers extract the raw data stored in the .hdf5 files and converts it into desirable data according to their message definitons.

Messages:
1. standard [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) sensor_msgs/msg/Image 
2. custom M2S2 flir_boson_interfaces/msg/ThermalRaw
3. custom M2S2 bme280_interfaces/msg/EnviroData
4. custom M2S2 radar_interfaces/msg/Frame
5. standard [ROS2](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2

## Usage

### BME280 Deserializer

This [deserializer](src/deserialize_bme280.cpp) converts a recorded ecal measurement of type [bme280_interfaces/msg/EnviroData](m2s2_ws/src/bme280_ROS2_driver/bme280_interfaces/msg/EnviroData.msg) into a JSON file with the following fields for each measurement: frame_id, timestamp_secs, timestamp_nanosecs, temperature, pressure, humidity.

build with:
```bash
cmake --build . --target bme280
```

run:
```bash
./ecal_sample_bme280 'meas_path' 'channel_name' 'out_file_name'
```

where:
- meas_path is the path to the input eCAL measurement file
- channel_name is the channel you wish to deserialize. (This is often 'rt/ros2_topic_name')
- out_file_name is the name of the JSON file you wish to save the data to

### FLIR Boson Deserializer

This [deserializer](src/deserialize_flir_boson.cpp) converts a recorded ecal measurement of type [flir_boson_interfaces/msg/ThermalRaw](m2s2_ws/src/flir_boson_ROS2_driver/flir_boson_interfaces/msg/ThermalRaw.msg) into raw 16 bit .png images, as well as grayscale false-coloured .jpeg images.

build with:
```bash
cmake --build . --target boson
```

run:
```bash
./ecal_sample_boson 'meas_path' 'channel_name' 'out_path_raw' 'out_path_rgb'
```

where:
- meas_path is the path to the input eCAL measurement file
- channel_name is the channel you wish to deserialize. (This is often 'rt/ros2_topic_name')
- out_path_raw is the path to where you wish to store the 16 bit raw images
- out_path_rgb is the path to where you wish to store the false-coloured images

### Ximea Camera Deserializer 

This [deserializer](src/deserialize_ximea.cpp) converts a recorded ecal measurement of type [sensor_msgs/msg/Image](http://docs.ros.org/en/noetic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/Image.html) into RGB .jpeg images.

<b>NOTE:</b> Ximea API's demosaic color defect correction is not optimized for ARM processors, and so performance may degrade significantly. To avoid this, we captured raw 8-bits or 16-bits images (by setting the <i>format</i> parameter to <b>RAW8</b> or <b>RAW16</b> in the config file of the [M2S2 ROS2 driver](add link)) and we post-process later using the API's [offline processing](https://www.ximea.com/support/wiki/apis/XiAPI_Offline_Processing), by saving the camera context each time data is collected.

build with:
```bash
cmake --build . --target ximea
```

run:
```bash
./ecal_sample_ximea 'meas_path' 'channel_name' 'cam_context_path' 'out_path'
```

where:
- meas_path is the path to the input eCAL measurement file
- channel_name is the channel you wish to deserialize. (This is often 'rt/ros2_topic_name')
- cam_context_path is the path to where the camera context file is saved for a specific measurement, to perform post-processing of the raw ximea images
- out_path is the path to where you wish to store the post-processed RGB images

### Radar Deserializer 

This [deserializer](src/deserialize_radar.cpp) converts a recorded ecal measurement of type [radar_interfaces/msg/Frame](m2s2_ws/src/radar_ROS2_driver/radar_interfaces/msg/Frame.msg) into a JSON file with the following fields for each radar frame: frame_id, timestamp_secs, timestamp_nanosecs, frame_size, frame_data.

build with:
```bash
cmake --build . --target radar
```

run:
```bash
./ecal_sample_radar 'meas_path' 'channel_name' 'out_file_name'
```

where:
- meas_path is the path to the input eCAL measurement file
- channel_name is the channel you wish to deserialize. (This is often 'rt/ros2_topic_name')
- out_file_name is the name of the JSON file you wish to save the data to


### Lidar Deserializer 

This [deserializer](src/deserialize_livox.cpp) converts a recorded ecal measurement of type [sensor_msgs/msg/PointCloud2](http://docs.ros.org/en/melodic/api/sensor_msgs/html/msg/PointCloud2.html) into a pcd file using the [Point Cloud Library](https://github.com/PointCloudLibrary/pcl). 

build with:
```bash
cmake --build . --target lidar
```

run:
```bash
./ecal_sample_lidar 'meas_path' 'channel_name' 'out_path'
```

where:
- meas_path is the path to the input eCAL measurement file
- channel_name is the channel you wish to deserialize. (This is often 'rt/ros2_topic_name')
- out_path is the path to where you wish to store the pcd files
